<h2>Discover and track your podcasts</h2>
<p>
gpodder.net is a libre web service that allows you to manage your
podcast subscriptions and discover new content. If you use multiple
devices, you can synchronize subscriptions and your listening progress.
</p>

<p>
It works best with the <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder</a>
application, but you can also use it with Amarok, other supported
clients or as standalone web application without any client app.
