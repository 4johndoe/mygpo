  <h1>my.gpodder.org</h1>
  <p>The new my.gpodder.org uses usernames instead of email addresses. Based on your email address, we think you might like <strong>{{username}}</strong>, but you can change that if you want to.</p>
  <form action="/migrate/" method="post">
  Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="{{ username }}"/><br /><br />
  <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>
  <p>You can keep your old user settings in gPodder. Once the next version (with lots of new features) is release, you'll have to replace your email address with your username.</p>
