1. Creating the database

In MySQL, do the following (the SUPER grant is needed for
triggers to work in MySQL 5.0):

  CREATE DATABASE mygpo;
  GRANT ALL ON mygpo.* TO mygpo@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
  GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO MYGPO@localhost;
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


2. Initialize the database

Run in the mygpo/ subdirectory (possibly after setting the
DB parameters in mygpo/settings.py):

  python manage.py syncdb

When asked to create a superuser, you can say YES.

Now, run every SQL-Script in the install/ subdirectory, starting
with "create.sql" and working your way all the way through the
update scripts (these are split because we are doing incremental
schema updates on the production server).


3. Setup the web server using lighttpd

There is a mygpo.lighttpd.conf file shipped with the source. Please
customize it to your needs, and then include it from your lighttpd
main configuration file.

4. Restart lighttpd

On Debian:

  /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart
