Basic setup
-----------

Here's how you start from scratch with a new mygpo install (assuming a
Ubuntu 12.04 x86 install, 'should work' with other versions/archs as well).

If you are on a Debian/Ubuntu system, do:

  sudo apt-get install erlang python-feedparser python-dateutil python-flup \
                       python-imaging python-pybabel python-restkit \
                       python-gevent

  sudo apt-get build-dep couchdb

  [ install couchdb 1.2.0 from source ]

Select a cozy place for the mygpo sources and clone it:

  git clone git://github.com/gpodder/mygpo.git
  cd mygpo

Now install additional dependencies locally (you could also use virtualenv or
some other fancy stuff, but for now, let's keeps things simple):

  mkdir lib
  cd lib

  git clone https://github.com/benoitc/couchdbkit.git
  mv couchdbkit couchdbkit-git
  ln -s couchdbkit-git/couchdbkit

  wget https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4/tarball/ -O Django-1.4.tar.gz
  tar xvf Django-1.4.tar.gz
  rm Django-1.4.tar.gz
  ln -s Django-1.4/django

  git clone https://github.com/stefankoegl/django-couchdb-utils.git
  ln -s django-couchdb-utils/django_couchdb_utils

That's it for the setup. Now to initialize the DB:

  python manage.py sync_couchdb
  python manage.py sync-design-docs

..and here we go:

  python manage.py runserver

Ok, so you need a user. This requires e-mails to be sent. If your machine is
configured to send e-mail, that should work out well. If not, you can use the
Django E-Mail File Backend to "send" mails to a local folder:

  mkdir inbox

Now, edit mygpo/settings_prod.py (or create it) and add the following lines:

  import os.path

  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'
  EMAIL_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'inbox')


Accessing the dev server from other devices
-------------------------------------------

Sometimes you might want to access the server from another machine than
localhost. In that case, you have to pass an additional argument to the
runserver command of manage.py, like this:

  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Beware, though, that this will expose the web service to your all networks
that your machine is connected to. Apply common sense and ideally use only
on trusted networks.


Resetting the database ("start from scratch")
---------------------------------------------

Delete the database:

  curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo
  curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo_sessions

Recreate the design documents:

  cd mygpo
  python manage.py sync_couchdb
  python manage.py sync-design-docs


Additional details on couchDB
-----------------------------

A source distribution of CouchDB can be obtained from

 http://couchdb.apache.org/downloads.html

Build and installation instructions can be found at

 http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation

If you want to avoid installing a CouchDB server yourself, you can use a free
CouchDB hosting service, for example from

 http://www.iriscouch.com/service

Please note, however, that hosted CouchDB services generally do not provide
security or authentication mechanisms, so this might only be useful for
development servers.

If you don't use a local database, you need to update the COUCHDB_DATABASES
setting (see the "Settings" section below).



1. Initializing an empty Database

To create the database, execute the following on the commandline

  curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo

To initialize the views, execute from the mygpo directory

  python manage.py sync_couchdb


2. Importing a Dump

To import a CouchDB dump, execute the following from the commandline

  gunzip -c <dumpfile.couch.gz> | couchdb-load http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo




Settings
--------

Check the settings in mygpo/settings.py. If you want to change any settings,
add them to mygpo/settings_prod.py with the correct value. If you want to
avoid warning messages on startup, simply:

  touch mygpo/settings_prod.py



Web-Server
----------

Django comes with a development webservice which you can run from the mygpo
directory with

  python manage.py runserver
