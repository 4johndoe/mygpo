mygpo
-----

The source for mygpo can be obtained via git

 git clone git://github.com/gpodder/mygpo.git



CouchDB
-------

A source distribution of CouchDB can be obtained from

 http://couchdb.apache.org/downloads.html

Build and installation instructions can be found at

 http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation

If you want to avoid installing a CouchDB server yourself, you can use a free
CouchDB hosting service, for example from

 http://www.iriscouch.com/service

Please note, however, that hosted CouchDB services generally do not provide
security or authentication mechanisms, so this might only be useful for
development servers.

If you don't use a local database, you need to update the COUCHDB_DATABASES
setting (see the "Settings" section below).



1. Initializing an empty Database

To create the database, execute the following on the commandline

  curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo

To initialize the views, execute from the mygpo directory

  python manage.py sync_couchdb


2. Importing a Dump

To import a CouchDB dump, execute the following from the commandline

  gunzip -c <dumpfile.couch.gz> | couchdb-load http://127.0.0.1:5984/mygpo



3. Building the Views

On the first request, CouchDB will build the views. To do this before the first
user hits the site (which is, of course, optional), execute

 bin/touch-views.sh



Settings
--------

Check the settings in mygpo/settings.py. If you want to change any settings,
add them to mygpo/settings_prod.py with the correct value.



Web-Server
----------

Django comes with a development webservice which you can run from the mygpo
directory with

  python manage.py runserver

If you want to run a production server, check out
